This module included logging of customer complaints, engineer allocation/de-allocation, and engineer tracking.</p> <h3>Attendance System:</h3> <p> Designed and developed Daily Attendance System for our branch offices by using Photo Entries. The system was designed using C# along with MSSQL and FTP protocol. </p> <h3>Automation of devices by WIFI enabled phones:</h3> <p> Designed and developed Android as well as IOS apps to control devices using WIFI modules via HTTP. </p> <h3>Service Report Management System:</h3> <p> Designed and developed service report management module using ASP.Net along with MSSQL. </p> <h3>Blood Flow Measurement using Piezo Film Sensor:</h3> <p> The project was to create a reusable low-cost Blood Flow Meter using vibration sensors and AVR micro-controller. The AVR was programmed using Embedded C language. </p> <h3>Cataract And Refractive vision Simulator:</h3> <p> Designed and developed Cataract and Refractive Vision Simulator for medical professionals using C#. It simulates the vision of person having cataract and/or refractive issues on the local images. It also simulates the surgery output for certain proprietary lenses. </p> <h3>Guidance Shoes for Blind:</h3> <p> Designed special shoes for blind as a college project using Ultrasound and IR transceiver and 555IC. It was designed to detect not only the obstacles but also the potholes. </p> <h3>Hospital's Electronics Record Management System:</h3> <p> Developed Hospital's Electronics Record Management System using ASP.net and MSSQL as a college project. </p> <h3>Inventory Management System:</h3> <p> Independently developed Inventory Management System for Equipment Division using Power builder (Sybase) for desktop and Java Spring MVC for Web and MSSQL. This module included parts inward, warehouse management, part outward and part tracking. </p> <h3>Other IT Related Projects:</h3> <p> Contributed to several indigenous program modules as add-ons to our existing ERP system. Developed multiple windows based as well as web-based programs like collection management system (PHP based), Internal work logging system (PHP), database modification logger (PowerBuilder), Conference sales lead tracking software (PHP) and Service Report Module. Also developed Android as well as IOS apps as per company's/client's requirement. </p> <h3>Phakic Lens Specification Calculator:</h3> <p> Designed and developed Phakic Lens Specification Calculator which included the processes like user registration, lens selections, order approvals, order processing along with the dispatch to customers.
